# 👋 Hi, I’m @Devanshi-Crypto
- 👀 I’m interested in coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...bits of everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. JK, some unique ideas that solves some recognized problems?

 As much as I'd love to be on a yatch in Monaco, living the life of my dreams, I'd be more thrilled to solve something which will help so many people in aspects no one could ever think.
 
 Coding gives me the ability to think things on a wider spectrum and makes me want to reach to the roots of things that intrigues me.
 
 I believe we evolve as a person everyday and the student in ourselves should forever be young.

You can reach out to me on my *LinkedIn* if you think, we can address issues or problems or even new concepts that can help us contribute to the society.
